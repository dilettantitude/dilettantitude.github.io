			<p>Ok, my parents are religious believers -- the fervent but liberal sort of. Ok, as soon as I move to a new city, they always line first to visit -- whatever it costs in terms of time and travel-pain. No exception to the rule, merely two weeks after I arrived, they were there. And I knew; I knew that we would walk a lot; We would talk a lot; We would eat and drink a lot; And also, we would visit a LOT of churches.</p>

<p>By <del>indoctrination</del> education, I kept a real, even affectionate, interest for holy houses. Yet, not as important as my parents'faith-driven one. Anyhow, scattered rains finally gave an edge for frequent wanders amid massive columns preceded by the echo of our steps. Italy being deeply influenced -- this is an euphemism -- by its catholic legacy, finding a church within one hundred meters was an easy task.</p>
<p>Now my parents are not doing things half. They systematically asked for information (in French), plundered my phone contract on WikipediA, collected any possible booklet hanging around, and asked for a more than two hours long audio-visit of the Duomo (through 120 points!!! The stations of the cross are only 14 by comparison...). I'll spare you the historical-architectural-political-religious details of these churches, just a few personal impressions and pictures.</p>
<p>Starting with one of the famous place in Milan, the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Cathedral" target="_blank">Duomo</a>". Architecturally speaking, it sets at the antipodes of my taste. The more I appreciate the moderate, harmonious, understated roman architecture of the early times of catholicism, the more I despise the arrogant, overloaded, ostentatious "flamboyant gothic". And the Duomo is an hyperbole of the latter. Untold number of statues pinned on any possible square centimeter left free between the uncountable sculptural artifacts. Furthermore, while the outside is a lightly gigantic wedding cake, the interior is expressionless, dull, leaving few ray of light through equally poorly realized stained glasses. In the words of Oscar Wilde</p>
<blockquote><p>The Cathedral is an awful failure. Outside the design is monstrous and inartistic. The over-elaborated details stuck high up where no one can see them; everything is vile in it; it is, however, imposing and gigantic as a failure, through its great size and elaborate execution.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="www.dilettantitude.de/assets/images/2012/05/CameraZOOM-20120626171226573.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1203" title="CameraZOOM-20120626171226573" src="www.dilettantitude.de/assets/images/2012/05/CameraZOOM-20120626171226573.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></a></p>
<p>Not to speak about the crowd inside, being <del>next to Armani</del> the hot spot for myriads of tourists. A bit upset and bored by the overall artistic level of the paintings, gigantic triptychs, the dull sculptures, I came across a special one which captured my attention for a long moment so much it contrasted with the overall ambiance. This is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_d%27Agrate" target="_blank">Marco d'Agrate</a>'s statue of St. Bartholomew. According to the legend, this rather unknown apostle was skinned alive and then crucified downwards. This gained him the honor of being the "<em>saint patron</em>" of the tanners. This is by far the best realization in this church and probably one of the most impressing sculpture I have seen in the past year. He is represented draped in its own skin, and it radiates an awkward feeling, at the intersection between horror, the peaceful even if dogmatic pose, and the very lively impression of this otherwise disfigured person. Impressive.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="www.dilettantitude.de/assets/images/2012/05/bartholome.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1198" title="bartholome" src="www.dilettantitude.de/assets/images/2012/05/bartholome.jpg" alt="" width="700" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="www.dilettantitude.de/assets/images/2012/05/picture5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1204" title="picture5" src="www.dilettantitude.de/assets/images/2012/05/picture5.jpg" alt="" width="700" /></a></p>
<p> On the other hand, the "Basilica di San Lorenzo" in front of the famous column of the same name, fits exactly in the roman atmosphere I enjoy. Build over several centuries, it is even more harmonious since it kept the Byzantine central symmetric-shape with an inner core surrounded by a circular walk and several chapels. Each of these chapels further reproduces, in a fractal type, the inner structure in a smaller dimension, diameter as well as height.</p>
<p>The overall ambiance could have made me stay several hours, and indeed I came back several times -- not the less in front of it, the column of St. Lorenzo place is the only place where public alcohol consumption is tolerated and young people gather there in a joyful atmosphere every evening in the fading temperature of the day.</p>
<p>A final religious place worth looking at is certainly the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimitero_Monumentale_di_Milano" target="_blank"><em>Cimeterio Monumental</em></a>", next to China Town, and the cultural center "<em>Fabbrica del Vapore</em>". Architecturally speaking, this is an incredible place, but wandering through these small chapels, tombs, elegant sculptures -- some astonishingly modern -- is a wonderful experience. It shows in particular how wealthy the longstanding "<em>Bourgeoisie</em>" of Milan actually is.</p>
