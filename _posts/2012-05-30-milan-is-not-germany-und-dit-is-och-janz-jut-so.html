<p>I was warned even before landing here: "You're going to Italy for 3 months in spring? Ouah. how lucky you are!<br />
- Yeah, Milan.<br />
- Ah... Well, coming from Germany, you won't be surprised..."</p>

<p>What an enthusiasm. Even natives from the north of Italy told me the same thing. Having distant memories of a chaotic month spent around Rome in the nineties I was curious to experience this unlikely beast with eagle's wings and wolf's <del>boobs</del> head. After almost two months, Milan is surely different from the typical "dolce vita" image  -- anyway, as any prejudices, they do not accommodate with reality -- and certainly from Rome, but it is really far from Germany!</p>
<p>Let's talk about the alleged efficiency. Clearly, coming back from Genoa the last week end, you feel the gap with Milan. Yet, here, things do not work as in Germany. One example to rule them all: cash-withdrawal. In Germany, whereas you'd better have an app to find the scarcely dispatched locked treasures, in Milan, ATM per square meters pops up as often as <del>dogs excrement in Friedrichs'hain</del> bankers at a free lunch. However, as soon as you get a German ATM, "ruckzuck", this a four steps move -- insert card, choose amount, give pin, get bucks -- to get your cash and run further your consumption driven life. In Milan, after several tests, you understand why there are so many. Be ready to slow down the frenetic plundering of your savings.</p>

<p>Well, spending so much time in front of an ATM with so many useless steps; you meant efficiency, did you? And this is an example within an ocean of similar situations. Go to the supermarket, and you will queue: out of ten cash-desks, only two are open while 80 % of the personal is arranging any single good into the right position in the shelves. In the time where your yogurt is scanned, an Aldi-employee would have swiped your entire purchase, dropped it into your shopping trolley, and you would feel his oppressing look and the reproachful ones of the next clients as you frantically search after your debit card. Go to a trendy much talk-about ice cream sale-place. While waiting fifteen minutes in the queue, you understand why it takes almost two minutes to get a "cono picolo con due savore". The waitress is not giving a shit about your feet enduring this standing position; no; she's doing art; she's modeling your ice you know; lovely; paying account to the perfect balance and shape of your ice on the cone; removing here, adding there, stepping back to appreciate the aesthetic quality of her work.</p>
<p>And let's talk about opening hours. Waking up, <del>punch drunk from the last evening</del> recovering from an intensive week of work, and going for a shopping-walk. Bad luck! It is 1pm; Siesta time. You desperately walk around trying to find something interesting to look at but then surrender your stomach for lunch. Bad luck! you wasted your time and now it is 2:30pm; Restaurants are closed and opening first at 7pm. Starving, you finally retreat into a fast food, and need 3-4 hours, lying the park, to <del>recover form this junk</del> digest your meal since most bars are still closed. You wake up and go further on your shopping tour. Bad luck! this is apero time; Shops are closed and bars are now opened. So you go and join friends for the apero. Your day: junk food, kilometers walking around, sun burn, and alcohol. Here you have to be in phase otherwise you get nothing except a bad health. In two months and so many tries, I only met my overwhelmingly nice backer twice! It seems, we live on two different planets.</p>
<p>So, Milan is definitely not Germany -- even if I do not deny that on this Protestant values scala, Rome or the south of Italy may be even more distant -- but it is alright so. In fact, I even have a theory on that point and it took me a while to figure out: this irritating inefficiency at a first glance is actually a social act! Indeed, this is a deliberated trick to gather random people at the same place and time. Remove your headphones, fade your upset face, and you get to converse with unknown persons while queuing. Redefining time as a social dimension. Instead of rushing along your optimized life, two minutes talking with the baker -- while persons are waiting behind you --  are no loss. What about this person I met on the street explaining me he were the reincarnation of Emile from Rousseau. Or, how appreciable it is to have (a real) lunch and (a real) coffee over more that one hour, debating passionately on culinary topics for instance. I do not prefer that Italian conception of efficiency to the one of Germany -- which is also overplayed --, it is only something different and worth to take the bright side of it.</p>
