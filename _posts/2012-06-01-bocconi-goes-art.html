<p><a href="http://www.graftonarchitects.ie/work/projects/project.php?resource_id=225&amp;image_id=621" target="_blank">Grafton</a> architects did a good job in designing the new building of Bocconi University; Straight and clear lines, massive perspectives, surreal subterranean structures, well of lights underlined by perfectly realized fair faced concrete blocks -- see some good pictures <a href="http://www.architonic.com/aisht/bocconi-university-metis-lighting-srl-/5101070" target="_blank">here</a>. Though, they did a good job mainly by providing a demonstratively ambitious building as a statement for what this university stays for in Italy. Italian "Kaderschmiede", élite school, ruling the caste of top manager in this country -- Mario Monti is an alumnus and was its President before his actual position. Yet, this institution is not a university but a business school -- don't search for any other faculty than economy, business and law. Observing the student here and there, you cannot avoid noticing it; Wealthy middle and upper class children (WASP) wanna-be manager, dressed like they were already some. Being private, the fees are high and probably yields to this monolithic community. Though, this is a pleasure to work there -- even if it lacks true black boards -- and the kind communicative atmosphere characterized by non-academic discussions.</p>

<p>But such a business school, where marketing rules, has to polish its image and a typical trend in this milieu is to go art; modern one. Wanted as a sign of openness, it eventually underlines the increased intertwining trend between modern art and market. Modern art belongs more than ever to the daily environment of these future politic and managerial elite as an asset. On this point, Bocconi business school does not make an exception to the rule. Arty it must be; arty it will be. At any corner of this huge building, pop up all possible modern compositions in a turnus worth of any international gallery; Thus, granting the noble letters to a business institution in search for some higher relevance than the barely, down to earth business education and research (even in academia, considered with disdain). The result is mixed. Many of the pieces are truly questionable. Here is a disrespectful overview of what I discovered and the reaction it provoked.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The psychotic walking girl</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="{{site.url}}/assets/images/2012/06/anim3.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1149" title="anim3" src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/2012/06/anim3.gif" alt="" width="320" height="240" /></a><br />
This one is freaking me out. This is not anyone's feeling. Some find it relieving. But hey, looking at this led animated walking girl is at best boring to death, most probably irritating. In this flashy orange, day and night, minute after minute, in a motion of barely one second, she walked head towards the hearth. Her gentle smoothly twirling skirt does not even help but thinking that it is insane. You arrive in the morning, she madly walks; you make a coffee break, she madly walks; you go for a lunch, she madly walks; you leave by night, she STILL FREAKING MADLY WALKS! And as for the "art content", this is nothing more than an animated gif in front of you day and night without the possibility to shut it down. No description so far from the artist, but as an impact it reaches at least one goal, I hate it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pixelized zoom onto the origin of the world</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="{{site.url}}/assets/images/2012/05/IMG_20120531_183555.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1119" title="IMG_20120531_183555" src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/2012/05/IMG_20120531_183555.jpg" alt="" width="400" /></a><br />
Just in front of our offices, no explanation needed, still wondering whether this is inspirational for mathematics...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smurfs' green party</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="{{site.url}}/assets/images/2012/06/IMG_20120605_214132.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="IMG_20120605_214132" src="assets/IMG_20120605_214132.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Originally, a green car suddenly appeared just below the stairs. An ode to an ecological conscientiousness?  A subtle critic of the automobile industry (Bocconi provides Fiat, Alpha Romeo, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Mazeratti &amp; Co so many top managers)? This was all but convincing. Some were really disappointed that their work environment were polluted by such an unwanted presence. Hence, Professor F., colleague of mine, decided to "enhance" a bit this <del>dullness</del> piece, by changing it into a pick-nick place for happy smurfs.</p>
<p><a href="{{site.url}}/assets/images/2012/05/IMG_20120504_115736.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1120" title="IMG_20120504_115736" src="assets/IMG_20120504_115736.jpg" alt="" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Dullness to dullness, the result of what might be called interactive art was at least successful and gained a lot of resonance. So much that the Public Relation troops organized a raid and decimated this peaceful community. Yet, the "<em>Blitzkrieg</em>" was not over; A counter attack got planned. Lead by the secretaries of the department and the captain in charge of this action Prof. F., they did not wait long to act. This poor synthetic green car became a funeral monument to the memory of these missing smurfs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, once again, the PR troops intervened again and devastated this memorial to restore the boring original we have to support every day while walking by.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The force of the vacuum</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="{{site.url}}/assets/images/2012/05/IMG_20120531_182749.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1114" title="IMG_20120531_182749" src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/2012/05/IMG_20120531_182749.jpg" alt="" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>It took a while to understand that this one was actually a pendulum. The construction is however not original, a smart french guy already had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum" target="_blank">idea</a>. However, in contrast to his predecessor, it does not bring to light the presence of a famous force -- discovered by another smart <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect" target="_blank">french guy</a> by the way. Actually, I don't know what it brings into light, except of clumsily moving here and there as the doors open and close. Jepp. This is another Bocconi's piece of <del>shit</del> art.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surge of the invisible class warfare</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="{{site.url}}/assets/images/2012/06/IMG_20120601_140433.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1162" title="IMG_20120601_140433" src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/2012/06/IMG_20120601_140433.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>This one is actually interesting. Even if the sun fake the atmosphere, it is sort of disturbing. The official aim, is to remind of those sacrificed on the altar of work. Unlike the other pieces, it provoked a lot of interest, professors, students, employees from the university passing by, stopping, taking pictures, passing between these invisible walking dead. On the one hand, this is surprising to see the confrontation of two different worlds through this piece of art. The observant, whom prospective life does not correspond to this picture, and the working class representatives, silent, invisible, dead, working-overalls flattering in the wind.</p>
<p>I was there as this piece was installed, and I witnessed a disconcerting situation. Naturally, the people installing the piece were simple workers, no sight of the famous trendy artist around, nor the PR management of the university. These workers were sweating while constructing this memorial of their own. And at one moment, there was this guy, exhausted after having installed one of these ghosts, standing there, alone, lost in the middle of the half installed pieces, wearing EXACTLY the same working overall, unique alive surrounded by his dead companions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The green a...</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="{{site.url}}/assets/images/2012/05/IMG_20120531_183453.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1118" title="IMG_20120531_183453" src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/2012/05/IMG_20120531_183453.jpg" alt="" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>I spare you the over classical 3x3 meters bright painting "<em>white rabbit posing in a snowy field in a white fog</em>", but this one is another stunning example of what we may call "<em>You just don't understand how deep is this piece, the underlying subversive charge it has</em>". Therefore, Prof F. (once again) denominated it "<em>The Green Arse</em>".</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diverse stuff around</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>From left to right: "<em>colorful diagonal rounded stripes</em>", "<em>Chunks of glas on balances</em>", "<em>Wall on wall with holes</em>".</p>
<p><a href="{{site.url}}/assets/images/2012/06/CameraZOOM-20120607174436951.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1165" title="CameraZOOM-20120607174436951" src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/2012/06/CameraZOOM-20120607174436951.jpg" alt="" width="700" /></a></p>
<p>You can imagine now how it is to concentrate on mathematics surrounded by all these <del>pieces over charged in psychotic-sexual-violence</del> profound objects. Yet, this is way better and enjoyable than working in an institute surrounded by nothing worth looking at, thinking at, joking at.</p>
